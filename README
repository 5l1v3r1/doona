        [ Bruteforce Exploit Detector - Doona fork ]

.:: About  ::.

  Doona is a fork of the Bruteforce Exploit Detector Tool (BED).
  BED is a program which is designed to check daemons for
  potential buffer overflows, format string bugs etc.

  Doona is Australian for duvet. It adds a significant enough number
  of features/changes to BED that I renamed it to avoid confusion.

  I hope you'll find it useful.
